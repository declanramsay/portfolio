    <img src="../assets/images/profile.png" alt="Profile picture of Declan Ramsay" class="responsive">
    <p>A recent graduate with dual citizenship in the UK and NZ, I have been working as a Web Developer on commercial projects for 2 years. Since leaving university I've gotten to work with some of the biggest names in New Zealand, helping them create beautiful and powerful web apps.</p>
    <p>Outside of work I am passionate about my music, having released 3 EPs, a single and an album, and I have toured NZ in 2015 and 2016. I am also beginning to catch the crossfit bug and love a good run.</p>
    <p>I'm currently based in Wellington New Zealand, but I am looking for new opportunities in the United Kingdom.</p>
