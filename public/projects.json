While the library's creator had built a website to paste posts to, the ability to select text and run the linter in an extension makes the library much more usable and accessible.</p>",

Spread over 5 cities, we performed to hundreds of people and travelled all the way from Auckland to Dunedin.</p> <p>Without a label or management, I was responsible for all aspects of organisation the tour including planning, budgeting, marketing, and finally performing. While the tour itself only last 2 and a half weeks, months of preparation went into making sure the tour would be a success.</p> <p>Ultimately despite being our debut tour, our first time performing in the South Island, and being entirely self-organised we were very successful and broke even by tour's end.</p> <iframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4LuFa1sVKX6l3ET94ohZ8w\" width=\"100%\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>",

I worked extensively throughout the codebase, particularly on their authentication flows, implementing their advertising solution, favouriting, and internal resolution of layout and module information provided by the API.</p> <p>For this project I also lead the team in embracing a style guide enforced by DockYard's <a href=\"https://github.com/DockYard/eslint-plugin-ember-suave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ember-suave</a> ESLint plugin. Implementing this style meant we had a consistent codebase which was easier to maintain and introduce other developers to. We also used TDD practices in building the internal layout resolution and Advertising.</p>",

Instead of sandboxing the internet banking experience and marketing site, The Co-operative Bank decided on a singular platform, allowing users to see their information without logging in and to traverse freely between their accounts and marketing information. This meant that information on the marketing side could be more targetted to their users' financial situation.</p><p>Working closely with The Co-operative Bank's developers I got to experience many aspects of development and I worked on both their initial release and subsequent feature cycles. I eventually stepped up to a more lead-like role on a number of their flows such as Overdraft and Personal Loan Origination, as well as the Join Us and Change Account flows.</p>",
